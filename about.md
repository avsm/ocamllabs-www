OCaml Labs is an initiative within the Cambridge Computer Laboratory started by [Anil Madhavapeddy](http://anil.recoil.org/) in 2011 to promote research, growth and collaboration within the wider OCaml community. We contribute to management of the day-to-day OCaml maintenance load, and align research agendas with real-world projects to help progress the language and make it available and applicable to a larger audience. Building on 40 years of language development, together with [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/) our goal is to freely release and integrate all work upstream, allowing all prospective users access to the efficient, expressive language of OCaml.

The [OCaml Labs team](http://ocamllabs.io/people/) is a distributed group of 50+ people, comprised of researchers at the [University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), industrial partners, student interns and individual collaborators. From a combination of research grant and industrial funding we are able to fund a small full-time team at the University of Cambridge, 2-4 student interns each academic year and regular community events to encourage contribution and collaboration.
