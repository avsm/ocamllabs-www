[AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) is a security-oriented fuzzer that uses compiler instrumentation to discover crashes in software programs.

`ocamlopt-afl` allows us to fuzz OCaml programs, and was merged into trunk for OCaml 4.05.

[ocaml-afl-persistent](https://github.com/stedolan/ocaml-afl-persistent) allows you to fuzz things really fast!
