[OCaml Java](http://www.ocamljava.org/) is a compiler from OCaml source code to Java bytecode, that can run on any modern Java runtime. This is an interesting way to explore the multicore runtime performance of OCaml with a highly concurrent collector, as is present in the latest JVMs.

The goal of this work is to stabilise and release the preview of 2.0, which greatly improves CPU utilisation and memory footprint.

Initial work on this feature was carried out between Apr 2013 - Aug 2013.
