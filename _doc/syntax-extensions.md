Since its creation camlp4 has proven to be a very useful tool. People have used it to experiment with new features for OCaml and to provide interesting meta-programming facilities. However, there is general agreement that camlp4 is too powerful and complex for the applications that it is most commonly used for, and there is a growing movement to provide a simpler alternative.

A [working group](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/wg-camlp4) was formed regarding the future of syntax extensions in OCaml (used mainly between Dec 2012 - Jun 2013. The aim of the working group is to formulate a solid transition plan to create a 'basic OCaml ecosystem' that does not require camlp4. Alain Frisch's introductory email has more detail and can be found in the [archive](http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-camlp4/2013-January/000000.html).
