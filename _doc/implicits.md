A common criticism of OCaml is its lack of support for ad-hoc polymorphism. The classic example of this is OCaml's separate addition operators for integers `(+)` and floating-point numbers `(+.)`. Another example is the need for type-specific printing functions (`print_int`, `print_string`, etc.) rather than a single print function which works across multiple types.

Taking inspiration from [Scala's implicits](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/implicit-parameters.html) and [Modular Type Classes]([http://www.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/papers/mtc/main-long.pdf), we propose a system for ad-hoc polymorphism in OCaml based on using modules as type-directed implicit parameters. You can try out an [interactive REPL](http://andrewray.github.io/iocamljs/modimp_show.html) of a prototype implementation online.

Our [modular implicits prototype](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-modular-implicits) was initially developed between Jan 2014 - Feb 2015, with more work taking place now in early 2017.
