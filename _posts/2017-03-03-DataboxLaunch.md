We are working with the team behind the [DataBox](http://www.databoxproject.uk) project to host an open-source community launch in Cambridge this spring.

Date: 24th March 2017
Venue: [Darwin College](https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/), [Cambridge CB3 9EU](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Darwin+College,+University+of+Cambridge/@52.2003721,0.1137535,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xedd32a8a29f90e53?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-1dmiorrSAhXILsAKHTlADpcQ_BIIeTAR)
Registration details: [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/databox-open-source-community-launch-tickets-32288471688) - registration closes on 10th March

## Background

The Databox Project is building an open-source personal networked device that mediates access to an individualâ€™s personal data by verified and audited, locally-executable, third party applications and services. The platform is built using Docker containers, and should work on any platform with Docker support. The research team is hoping to provide support for ARM devices such as the Raspberry Pi 3 in this initial release, as well as x86 NUCs.

## Launch Event

This event provides the opportunity for the team to introduce the Databox in its current form, where they also hope to engage with security & privacy enthusiasts, data visualisation & analytics fans, as well as potential app developers to begin building a community and ecosystem around the Databox.

Contributions of all kinds are welcome, for example: improvements to core components; integration with your favourite IoT devices, brainstorming which apps and devices you want to see supported by the Databox!
