This [beta 3 release](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta3) brings speed and stability improvements, replaces the opam build command with opam install <dir>, provides a clearer interface for handling package test and doc dependencies, and extends the CLI in a few areas.

Originally `opam build` was added to:

 - provide an easier way to start projects without a pre-existing opam installation
 - allow direct interaction with projects in a current directory
 - copy installed files of a package below a specified `destdir`

Feedback highlighted that the interface was difficult in places, and the command name misleading, so `opam install <dir>` was created as a replacement - still addressing the above issues, and providing a clearer interface. Read more about the details on the [opam blog](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-install-dir/).
