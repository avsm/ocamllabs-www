Stephen Dolan's PhD thesis on "[Algebraic Subtyping](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/thesis.pdf)" is now available ([comment thread](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/thesis.pdf)).

> Type inference gives programmers the benefit of static, compile-time type checking without the cost of manually speci- fying types, and has long been a standard feature of functional programming languages. However, it has proven difficult to inte- grate type inference with subtyping, since the unification engine at the core of classical type inference accepts only equations, not subtyping constraints.
>
> This thesis presents a type system combining ML-style para- metric polymorphism and subtyping, with type inference, prin- cipal types, and decidable type subsumption. Type inference is based on biunification, an analogue of unification that works with subtyping constraints.
