Building on the success of our [ICFP liveblog](http://canopy.mirage.io/Liveblog), Frédéric Bour, Stephen Dolan and Jeremy Yallop are [liveblogging](http://popl2017.ocaml.io/) their attendance at the 44th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages [(POPL)](http://conf.researchr.org/home/POPL-2017) in Paris this year. All attendees are encouraged to contribute, and all notes added will be archived for future reading after the event.

We are using [Canopy](https://github.com/engil/canopy) blog software served via an OCaml [MirageOS](https://mirage.io/) unikernel running on the [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/).
