Jeremy Yallop announced the 0.6.0 release of
[ocaml-ctypes](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes), which is now
[available](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ctypes/ctypes.0.6.0/) on
OPAM.

Besides several new features such as support for asynchronous foreign
function calls and improved cross compilation support, this release
introduces a number of backwards-incompatible changes, which are
described below. If your code is available on OPAM and is affected by
these changes then you should have received a pull request with a fix.
If you have questions about how to update your code, please feel free to
post to the [mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/ctypes).

Selected new features:

-   The Cstubs.FOREIGN interface has been extended with `returning` and
    `@->`, and with some new types. See
    [PR\#389](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/389) for
    details.  
    NB: code that generates bindings using Cstubs may need to be updated
    to select return and @-&gt; from the bindings functor argument
    rather than from the Ctypes module. Code that needs to be updated
    will fail to compile with the new interface. The pull request shows
    how to update your code, if necessary.
-   The Cstubs module can now generate asynchronous bindings to C
    functions using the [Lwt
    jobs](https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/blob/master/src/unix/lwt_unix_stubs.c#L904)
    framework. See the
    [PR\#391](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/391) for
    details.
-   The Cstubs module now supports optionally returning errno alongside
    the return value of bound C functions. See
    [PR\#392](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/392) for
    details.
-   Cross-compilation support is improved: the configuration step no
    longer runs binaries on the host. See
    [PR\#383](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/383) for
    details.
-   The Unsigned.S interface has new `of_int64` and `to_int64`
    functions.

### Compatibility

Besides the changes to `Cstubs.FOREIGN`, ocaml-ctypes 0.6.0 introduces
the following backwards-incompatible changes:

-   The deprecated `*:*` and `+:+` functions have been removed. Use
    `Ctypes.field` instead.
-   OCaml 4.00.\* is no longer supported. The earliest supported OCaml
    release is 4.01.0.
