Jeremy Yallop and Ohad Kammar are hosting a [summer school on
metaprogramming](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/metaprog2016/) this
year, at [Robinson College](http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge.
There are 7 great lecturers scheduled to talk about staged and generic
programming, including [Philip
Wadler](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/) from the University of
Edinburgh, [Simon Peyton
Jones](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/) from MSR,
and [Oleg Kiselyov](http://okmij.org/ftp/) from Tohoku University.

Metaprogramming techniques treat program fragments as values to be
manipulated, and the summer school seeks to explore state-of-the-art in
this approach and its wider application, covering both theory and
practice.

The summer school runs from **8-12 August 2016**, and will be held at
Robinson College. More details, including registration, costs and
timetable [here](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/metaprog2016/).

Metaprogramming is an approach to improving programs by treating program
fragments (such as expressions or types) as values that the program can
manipulate.

Metaprogramming Overview
------------------------

Metaprogramming comes in various forms, including:

-   **Staged programming**: treating expressions as program values. The
    execution of a staged program is spread over several phases, with
    each stage using the available data to generate specialized code.
    Staged programming has a wide variety of applications â€” numeric
    computations, parsing, database queries, generic programming, domain
    specific languages, and many more. Precompiling the staged code can
    have dramatic performance improvements, in some cases an order of
    magnitude or more.

-   **Generic programming**: treating types as program values. Generic
    programming can improve code flexibility, allowing to give a single
    definition of a function that operates in a predictable (but not
    uniform) way on many different types. Generic programming techniques
    can be used to define a wide variety of functions, including
    traversals, comparisons, pretty printers, serialization functions,
    and many more.
