The new release of Merlin is now available on OPAM.

It can be installed with `opam install merlin` or built from sources,
available at from the
[repository](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin).

```
Changes in version 2.5.1
------------------------

-   Improved handling of case sensitivity on macOS.
-   Gerd Stolpmann contributed support for customizing findlib package
    directories. This is achieved by the FINDLIB\_PATH directive in
    .merlin (it corresponds to the path variable in findlib.conf, and
    OCAMLPATH environment variable for ocamlfind).
-   For convenience with Bucklescript FFI, Merlin no longer checks that
    externals are functions.
```

Version 2.5.2 added support for OCaml 4.04 and fixed a lot of bugs.

As always you can find a full
[changelog](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/blob/master/CHANGELOG).

Thanks to Frederic Bour, Gerd Stolpmann, previous contributors and the
rest of the Merlin team!
