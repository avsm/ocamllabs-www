We held the 17th Compiler Hacking Event this week, on a balmy Cambridge evening, and we've added [summaries](http://reynard.io/2017/05/19/CompHackingRoundup.html) of what everyone was working on that evening including:

* Meeting the group from Citrix working with Opam, some of whom are quite new to OCaml
* Closing OCaml PRs, reviewing code and bug fixing
* Getting stuck into Multicore!

We added some new projects to the ["Things to Work On"](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on) list, and we will continue to update the projects over the coming weeks. There's lots of interest in OCaml hack events and meetups outside of Cambridge too, so we will also make the project list more accessible for external organisers.
