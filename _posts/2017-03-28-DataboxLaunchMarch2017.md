The [Databox Project](http://www.databoxproject.uk/) team hosted their Cambridge open-source community launch on Friday 24th March at [Darwin College](https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge. The event had 30+ signups, with people attending to discover more about the motives behind Databox, the structure of the project, and how to write compatible applications for use with the platform. The initial release includes basic data collection support through mobile sensing libraries and selected APIs, data flow policing and privacy policy enforcement.
