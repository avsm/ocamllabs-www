Jeremy Yallop has submitted an [extensive PR](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/1201) to add support for unsigned 32-bit and 64-bit integers. This feature is frequently requested, and the PR details the motivation behind the addition of primitive types, standard library modules, syntax for expressions and patterns, as well as suggesting ideas for future enhancement.

Unsigned integers could be added as built-in OCaml types, and Jeremy describes the advantages of doing so over adding them as a library. The features will help improve a variety of large projects such as [MirageOS](https://mirage.io/) and [F*](https://www.fstar-lang.org/) - join the [conversation on the PR](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/1201) and give your feedback.
