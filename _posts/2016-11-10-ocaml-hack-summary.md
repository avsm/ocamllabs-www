OCaml Labs held the [fifteenth compiler hack
event](https://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2016/11/01/fifteenth-compiler-hacking-evening.html)
on 9th November at Pembroke College with over 20 people in attendance.
We opened it up to MirageOS users and developers ahead of the upcoming
3.0 release and welcomed a varied group of students and developers from
a huge range of organisations. See the summaries and attendance list
