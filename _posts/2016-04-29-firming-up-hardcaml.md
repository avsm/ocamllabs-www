[HardCaml](/wiki/HardCaml "wikilink") was introduced by [Andy Ray](https://github.com/ujamjar/) last year as a way to write RTL
hardware descriptions. An OCaml Labs intern, [Chaitanya
Mangla](https://github.com/cmangla/), spent some time working with
HardCaml to go from OCaml code to RTL descriptions to actual FPGA
device.

His detailed experiences are recorded in [his GitHub repo](https://github.com/cmangla/altera-sockit-hardcaml/), and we've
extracted from that to [create the Wiki
page](https://ocaml.io/w/HardCaml) in the hope that it can be extended
and updated over time. Please do take a look, and add any experiences or
further details targeting different hardware platforms.
