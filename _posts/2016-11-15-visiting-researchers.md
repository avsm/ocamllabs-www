We are always excited to host interns and visitors to the lab, and we
have some new and familiar faces with us this term.

**Olivier Nicole**: After a very successful few months in the lab over
the summer, and providing invaluable help at OCaml Workshop and ICFP,
Olivier is back in the lab to continue work on his [Macros
implementation](https://github.com/ocamllabs/Projects/blob/master/MacrosProposal2016:17.pdf).

**Maxime Lesourd**: Maxime finished his Masters in Theoretical Computer
Science at ENS de Lyon, and is here for 5 months to continue the
previous work started by Armael on the compilation of effects in OCaml
using a type directed selective CPS transform.

**Takayuki Imada**: Takayuki Imada is a researcher at Hitachi Ltd. Japan
working on server virtualization hypervisor work. He has interests in
Unikernel technology and IoT-related computing frameworks (Fog/edge
computing) and is working on improving network performance on MirageOS.
