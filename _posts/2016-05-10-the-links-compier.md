title: The missing Links compiler - with multi-shot effect handlers

[Daniel Hillerstr√∂m] visited us for the last two weeks to work on a native
backend for [Links](http://blog.dhil.net/posts/2015-11-15-programming-with-effect-handlers-in-links-1.html) with effect handlers, based on KC's multicore work in OCaml. It was a very
productive couple of weeks, and Daniel managed to implement a compiler
for an interesting subset of Links with multi-shot effect handlers.
It's a work in progress, but this is an excellent start! Daniel
also [presented](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1467124/talks/ocl2016-04.pdf)
his work to the Systems Research Group in the lab, and we look forward
to welcoming Daniel back later this summer.
