The 2017 MirageOS Hack Retreat in Marrakech is over, but you can experience the fun and hard work vicariously by reading the detailed [trip reports](https://mirage.io/blog/2017-march-hackathon-roundup) we've collected!

A huge thanks to [Hannes Mehnert](https://twitter.com/h4nnes) for organising the event and sharing the highly sophisticated "paper slides" and [daily tweets](http://ocamllabs.io/events/2017/03/06/MirageHackUpdates.html).
