The newest version of OCaml 4.04.0 is here!

Main features
-------------

A major addition to this release is
[Spacetime](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/spacetime.html):
a new memory profiler. It records how your program executes so it can
reliably tell you the full stack backtrace at every point in the program
that caused an allocation.

See the main
[announcement](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2016-11/msg00010.html)
and details of
[changes](https://github.com/gasche/ocaml-releases-change-explanation/wiki/4.04.0-changes-explanation).

This is the first of the new OCaml releases that will be every 6 months,
as planned by Damien Doliguez at the [OCaml Workshop
2016](https://github.com/ocamllabs/icfp2016-blog/blob/master/OCaml/invited-talk.md).
OCaml 4.05.0 will be feature-frozen on 1st February 2017.
