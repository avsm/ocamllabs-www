We have been [refreshing](http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2016-December/000624.html) the [OCaml GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ocaml) in an effort to better manage the growing number of projects integral to the core OCaml distribution. We are happy to announce that in recognition of its importance to the OCaml language and ecosystem as a whole, [Merlin](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin) has been promoted as a headline project of OCaml.

Merlin is the defacto editor tool for OCaml, with support for [Vim](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/vim-from-scratch), [Emacs](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/emacs-from-scratch), [Acme](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/acme-from-scratch), [Atom](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/atom-from-scratch), [Spacemacs](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/spacemacs-from-scratch), [VSCode](https://github.com/hackwaly/vscode-ocaml) and [Sublime Text](https://github.com/cynddl/sublime-text-merlin). It is maintained by Frédéric Bour and Thomas Refis, and has contributions from over 30 individuals. We hope that Merlin's inclusion in the OCaml core organisation encourages further support and contribution from the community - join the discussion on the [Merlin mailing list](https://lists.forge.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/merlin-discuss) and get up to date with the current state and future plans using the [project roadmap](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/projects).
