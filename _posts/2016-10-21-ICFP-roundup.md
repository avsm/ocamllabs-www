ICFP 2016 is over!

OCaml Labs participated heavily in the conference this year, with 7
presentations at the OCaml Workshop, 7 talks across the co-located
workshops, and the OCaml Tutorial afternoon. Thank you to all of our
student interns who volunteered at the conference, liveblogged and
presented their work!

You can see a summary of each of the talks at the OCaml Workshop here:
