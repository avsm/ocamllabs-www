Today at
[OSCON](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us/public/schedule/detail/51393)
Docker [open-sourced](https://blog.docker.com/) ([in
real-time!](https://twitter.com/christylea/status/732947071381037056))
[Datakit](https://github.com/docker/datakit),
[Hyperkit](https://github.com/docker/hyperkit) and
[VPNKit](https://github.com/docker/vpnkit) - all components of their
beta application [Docker for Mac and
Windows](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/).
The app is incredibly popular (with 30,000 signups in the first 24
hours), and releasing the internals allows us to see why.

Datakit (interfaced with Hyperkit) is a tool to orchestrate applications
using the 9p workflow. It builds on
[work](https://mirage.io/blog/introducing-irmin) carried out at OCaml
Labs in the past few years and allows you to define
complex build pipelines over version-controlled data using file system commands.

By open sourcing these projects, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) shows
they are keen for discussion and collaboration. We are excited about
this release, and we envisage integrating the components into our work
at OCaml Labs, specifically using
[Quelea](http://kcsrk.info/Quelea/)-style contracts for consistency
control with Datakit.
