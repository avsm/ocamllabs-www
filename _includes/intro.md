The goal of OCaml Labs is to push [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) and functional programming forward as a platform, making it a more effective tool for current users (including significant industrial users) and at the same time growing the appeal of the language, broadening its applicability and popularity by a combination of technological advancements, creation of community infrastructure, and public communications.

This effort is run across multiple groups in the Computer Laboratory, primarily the SRG and PLS, and including collaborators from the Security, CompArch and DTG groups. We would like to especially thank our primary funder, [Jane Street](http://janestreet.com), for their generous support.
